<p style="box-sizing: inherit; font-family: Slack-Lato, appleLogo, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures; orphans: 2; widows: 2; text-decoration-thickness: initial;">Back when I was a freshman, I was by no means interested in fraternity life. As such, despite friends of mine who tried to convince me to attend a few rush events, I decided to spend the entire rush period simply within my dorm room. I did not attend rush, and this is among my greatest regrets. I wish I had partaked in the fun of rush, but moreso, I wish I had found this community at Beta earlier.</p>
<p style="box-sizing: inherit; font-family: Slack-Lato, appleLogo, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures; orphans: 2; widows: 2; text-decoration-thickness: initial;">I ended up rushing in the spring, and since Fall Rush had traditionally been the major rushing period, my first genuine Rush experience came in Fall 2019. And it was some serious fun. That time genuinely constituted some of the most enjoyable weeks of my time at MIT.</p>
<p style="box-sizing: inherit; font-family: Slack-Lato, appleLogo, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures; orphans: 2; widows: 2; text-decoration-thickness: initial;">This year's rush may be virtual, but it still is fundamentally constructed around giving you all an enjoyable experience and memories for years to come. Even if you are skeptical about fraternity life, I would strongly encourage you to still attend a few rush events, because I guarantee you that you will have fun. And who knows, you may find yourself a community that you feel at home with, a community to live and grow in, a community where you will forge inextricable bonds of friendship.</p>
<p style="box-sizing: inherit; font-family: Slack-Lato, appleLogo, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; font-variant-ligatures: common-ligatures; orphans: 2; widows: 2; text-decoration-thickness: initial;">So please don't make the same mistake I made my freshmen year. With no formal school commitments, this upcoming week is a great opportunity to check out rush, and I sincerely hope you do!</p>
